We often feel anxious, worried, sad in our day to day lives. Whether it’s about a coming interview, failure in exam, rejection or even the present Covid situation. What we need to understand is that it is very natural and can happen to anyone. But the good thing here is that we can overcome it. We can in fact change our behaviour and response to the situations happening around us. One of the ways to change this behavior is CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) which often psychologists use to improve the mental health of their patients. A therapy is basically defined as a learning process through which an individual acquires an ability to speak to himself in appropriate ways so as to control his own conduct. (Ellis, 1962). It has proven in many studies that CBT is very useful to reduce stress, cope with complicated relationships, deal with grief, and face many other common life challenges.

In this post I’ll be guiding you about what CBT is and how you can use it by giving an example(I would like to put a disclaimer here that I’m no expert in CBT and explaining what I have gained from a Psychology course at my college). I think it’s very important for all of us to understand some kind of these techniques to deal with some of the mental health challenges we face.

CBT is based on the assumption that our thoughts affect our behaviour. Irrational thoughts can lead to psychological problems and behind every worry, stress, sadness there is one irrational thought that would be causing you mental trouble. So, through therapy we try to reach that irrational thought and change it which leads to improvement in the behaviour and relieves us of our mental problems.
Let’s first discuss what are some patterns of irrational thinking. Following are some of them :

• **Arbitrary interference**: Drawing conclusions on the basis of sufficient or irrelevant evidence: for example, thinking you are worthless because an open air concert you were going to see has been rained off. 

• **Selective abstraction**: Focusing on a single aspect of a situation and ignoring others: E.g., you feel responsible for your team losing a football match even though you are just one of the players on the field.

• **Magnification**: exaggerating the importance of undesirable events. E.g., if you scrape a bit of paint work on your car and, therefore, see yourself as a totally awful driver.

• **Minimisation**: underplaying the significance of an event. E.g., you get praised by your teachers for an excellent term’s work, but you see this as trivial.

• **Overgeneralization**: drawing broad negative conclusions on the basis of a single insignificant event. E.g., you get a D for an exam when you normally get straight As and you, therefore, think you are stupid.

• Personalisation: Attributing the negative feelings of others to yourself. E.g., your teacher looks really cross when he comes into the room, so he must be cross with you.
The process in CBT is to get to the real irrational thought and what is the reality behind and try to change and suggest some behaviour change which can help in improving the thoughts and ultimately the mental health.
In the following table I’m taking an hypothetical situation and presenting a table to show how you can identify various irrational thoughts.

**Situation/Problem**{: style="color: red"} : The best friend of the client who was also a potential romantic
partner for him left her because of some other guy. This was a devastating life
event which made him feeling low and depressed.
